# Annsetu

Annsetu is a lightweight progressive web experience built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It connects hostels, hotels, lawns, and NGOs to coordinate the donation and distribution of leftover food. This project also integrates social media sponsorship updates, government policy compliance notes, and local rewards for participation.
